git showed the lines
inserted and deleted in the 
new file comparing it with the
old file.

how could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient  programmer in long term?
	firstly, it helps to catch a bug easily as stated earlier
	secondly, helps to go back and check for errors and
	restore the earlier working version

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing 
when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having 
versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?
		pros, we can have the logically seperation in between commits
		con, we may forget/miss to do the commit 

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow 
saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google 
Docs, treat each file separately?
		This is to facilitate the dependence among the various files

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

		Git log gives the history of changes during every commit along with the commit ID. Git diff gives difference between two versions

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?

		we can checkout any version of commit and get to know
		which verison caused the bug.
